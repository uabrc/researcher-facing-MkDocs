# Cloud.rc Account Management

These instructions are intended to guide researchers on creating and managing their [Cloud.rc](../uab_cloud/index.md) account.

## Creating a New Account

To create a new account, please contact [Support](../help/support.md) with the following information.

- Full name
- BlazerID
- Intended use of the system (see some [common use cases](#common-use-cases)).

When we have received your email, we will reach out to you with any clarifying questions and account credentials. Once you have credentials, please see our [Cloud.rc page](../uab_cloud/index.md) and [Tutorial page](../uab_cloud/tutorial/index.md) for next steps.

## Common Use Cases

Some common use-cases for the Cloud.rc system include, but are not limited to, the following.

- Experimental research software testing and development at a small scale. Experimental here means software that isn't yet proven.
- Packaging research software into [containers](../workflow_solutions/getting_containers.md) for use on [Cheaha](../cheaha/index.md).
- _Temporary_ hosting of small-scale server software for proofs of concept or other scientific development and experimentation.

Note the common thread of temporary and small-scale workflows. Cloud.rc is not intended for long-term server hosting or science gateways. If you need long-term server hosting or science gateways, please contact [Support](../help/support.md) so we can point you in the right direction. It is also not intended for large-scale batch processing, please use [Cheaha](../cheaha/index.md) instead.
