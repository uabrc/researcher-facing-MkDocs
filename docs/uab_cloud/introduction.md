# UAB Cloud

Our [cloud.rc](https://dashboard.cloud.rc.uab.edu) portal, based on [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) cloud software, provides a home for more permanent research applications such as web pages and database hosting, as well as a place where researchers can more fluidly develop applications for high performance compute. In contrast with our High Performanc Computing (HPC) environment Cheaha, where all jobs must have a time limit, instances on cloud.rc are allowed to exist indefinitely. Resource quotas are set to ensure that every researcher has a fair share. Currently, access to cloud.rc must be made while on campus, or on the campus Virtual Private Network (VPN). For more information about using the VPN, please visit [VPN - UAB IT](https://www.uab.edu/it/home/tech-solutions/network/vpn).

To get started using cloud.rc, please navigate to <https://dashboard.cloud.rc.uab.edu/>. For a first time setup, it is highly recommended to visit the Setup pages in order. Network setup is a create-once, use-many set of instructions which provides a foundation for instances, volumes, and other features. Instances provide homes for services and are connected to the outside world, and each other, via the network. Volumes provide storage which can be moved among instances or held for future use.
