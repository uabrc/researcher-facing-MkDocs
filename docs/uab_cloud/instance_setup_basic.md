# Basic Instance Setup

Instances are the basic unit of compute on OpenStack. Requesting an instance involves a number of steps, and requires that a [Network](network_setup_basic.md) has already been setup. It is also possible to attach persistent reusable [Volumes](volume_setup_basic.md) to instances.

## Creating an Instance

Creating an instance is possibly a step you'll perform often, depending on your workflow. There are many smaller steps to create an instance, so please take care to check all the fields when you create an instance.

These instructions require that you've set up a [Network](network_setup_basic.md) and followed all of the instructions on the linked page. You should have a Network, Subnet, Router and Floating IP. You will also need to setup a
[Key Pair](security_setup_basic.md#creating-a-key-pair) and an [SSH Security Group](security_setup_basic.md#creating-a-security-group).

1. Click "Compute" in the left-hand navigation pane to open the fold-out menu.

    ![!OpenStack Overview page. ><](./images/key_pairs_000.png)

2. Click "Instances".

    ![!OpenStack Instances page. The Instances table is empty. ><](./images/instances_001.png)

3. Click "Launch Instance" to open a dialog box.

4. Fill out the dialog box completely. There are several tabs that will need to be completed.

    ![!Launch Instance dialog. The dialog form has multiple tabs on the left menu. The Details tab is selected. The Details dialog form is empty except the Instance Name is set to my_instance. ><](./images/instances_002.png)

5. "Details" tab.

    1. Enter an "Instance Name".
    2. Enter a "Description".
    3. Select "nova" in the "Availability Zone" drop down box.
    4. Select "1" in the "Count" field.
    5. Click "Next \>" to move to the "Source" tab.

6. "Source" tab. Sources determine what operating system or pre-defined image will be used as the starting point for your operating system (OS).

    1. Select "Image" in the "Select Boot Source" drop down box.
    2. Select "Yes" under "Create New Volume".
    3. Choose an appropriate "Volume Size" in `GB`. Note that for many single-use instances, `20 GB` is more than enough. If you need more because you have persistent data, please create a `persistent volume<volume_setup_basic>`.
    4. Select "Yes" or "No" under "Delete Volume on Instance Delete"
        1. "Yes" is a good choice if the OS volume will be reused.
        2. "No" is a good choice if you don't care about reusing the OS.

        ![!Manage Floating IP Associations dialog. The form is filled out. The Floating IP Address created earlier is selected under IP Address. The port from the Instance my_instance is selected under Port to be Associated. ><](./images/instances_017.png)

At this stage you should be able to SSH into your instance from on
campus or on the UAB VPN.

## SSH Into the Instance

If you are following the steps from top to bottom, then at this stage you should be able to SSH into your instance from on campus or on the UAB VPN. To do so be sure your local machine has ssh and then use the following command If you are using a different operating system, such as CentOS, replace the user `ubuntu` with `centos` or whatever is appropriate. The value `<floating ip>` should be whatever IP was assigned in [Creating a Floating IP](./network_setup_basic.md#creating-a-floating-ip), and the value `<keypair_name>` should be whatever your keypair file was named from [Creating a Key Pair](./security_setup_basic.md#creating-a-key-pair).

``` bash
ssh ubuntu@<floating ip> -i ~/.ssh/<keypair_name>.pem
```

![!MINGW64 terminal on Windows. The ssh command has been used to login to the Floating IP Address using the -i command with the locally stored private key my_key_pair.pem. Login was successful. A banner page has been shown and a terminal prompt is waiting for input. ><](./images/instances_020.png)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
!!! note

    Reusing a floating IP for a new instance can result in a "host key changed" error. To resolve this issue, please use the command below with the value `<hostname>` replaced by the value given in error. When dealing with cloud.rc, this value should be the affected floating IP.

    ``` bash
    ssh-keygen -R <hostname>
    ```

    ![! image showing host key changed error at terminal ><](./images/instances_ssh_host_key_error.png)
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD046 -->

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
!!! danger

    Using the command `ssh-keygen -R <hostname>` is potentially dangerous when connecting to machines or instances controlled by other people. Be absolutely certain you trust the source of the key change before using the command above.
