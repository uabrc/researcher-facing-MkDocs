# Basic Network Setup

Networking setup should be a one-time setup. While Floating IPs fall under the Networking fold-out, they should be allocated and released together with instances to maximize security.

## Creating a Network

1. Click "Network" in the left-hand navigation pane to open the fold-out menu.

    ![!cloud.rc Overview page. Networks is selected in the Network Topology fold-out menu in the left-hand navigation pane. ><](./images/networks_000.png){: style="width:70%"}

2. Click "Networks" in the fold-out menu.

    1. The "Networks" page will open.
    2. The "uab_campus" network entry should already be in the table.

        ![!cloud.rc Networks page. The Networks table has one entry. The entry is the default, persistent uab-campus network. ><](./images/networks_001.png){: style="width:70%"}

3. Click "+ Create Network" to open a dialog box.

4. Fill out the dialog box. Only the "Network" tab is important, we
    will create a subnet as a separate step.

    1. Enter a "Network Name".
    2. Leave "Enable Admin State" checked.
    3. Uncheck "Create Subnet". We will do this as a separate step. The other tabs should be removed.
    4. Leave the "Availability Zone Hints" box empty.

        ![!Create Network dialog. The dialog form is empty except Network Name has been set to my_network. ><](./images/networks_003.png){: style="width:70%"}

5. Click "Create".

    1. Redirects to the "Networks" page.
    2. There should be a new entry in the table with the name given in (4.a)

        ![!cloud.rc Networks page. There is an additional entry in the table. The new entry is my_network. ><](./images/networks_004.png){: style="width:70%"}

## Creating a Subnet

1. Click "Network" in the left-hand navigation pane to open the
    fold-out menu.

    ![!cloud.rc Overview page. Networks is selected in the Network Topology fold-out menu in the left-hand navigation pane. ><](./images/networks_000.png){: style="width:70%"}

2. Click "Networks" in the fold-out menu.

    1. The "Networks" page will open.
    2. The "uab_campus" network should already be an entry in the table.
    3. At least one other entry must be in the table. See `Creating a Network`.

        ![!cloud.rc Networks page. There are two entries in the table. One is the default, persistent uab-campus network. The other is my_network. ><](./images/networks_004.png){: style="width:70%"}

3. Under the "Actions" column, select the drop-down triangle button in the row corresponding to the network you want to add a subnet to.

    ![!Drop-down box under the Actions column in the my-network row of the Networks table. The drop-down box has been clicked, revealing two options. The selected option is Create Subnet. ><](./images/subnet_002.png){: style="width:70%"}

4. Click "Create Subnet" in the drop-down to open a dialog box.

5. Fill out the dialog box.

    1. The "Subnet" tab.

        1. Enter a "Subnet Name".
        2. Enter `192.168.0.0/24` as the "Network Address". The trailing `/24` allocates the entire range from `192.168.0.0` through `192.168.0.255` to the subnet.
        3. Ensure "IPv4" is selected in the "IP Version" drop-down box.
        4. Leave "Gateway IP" empty to use the default value of `192.168.0.0`.
        5. Leave "Disable Gateway" unchecked.
        6. Click the "Next \>\>" button to move to the "Subnet Details" tab.

            ![!Create Subnet dialog box. The Subnet tab is selected. The form has not been filled out beyond default values. The Subnet Name has been set to my_subnet. ><](./images/subnet_003.png){: style="width:70%"}

        <!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
        !!! note

            If you receive an error like

            ```
            Failed to create subnet `192.168.0.0/24`...
            Invalid input for operation: Gateway is not valid on a subnet.
            ```

            Try changing the gateway IP address to `192.168.0.1` and trying again.
        <!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->

    2. The "Subnet Details" tab.

        1. Leave "Enable DHCP" checked.
        2. Enter `192.168.0.20,192.168.0.100` in the "Allocation Pools" box. The IP addresses in that range will be assigned to instances on this subnet.
        3. Leave "DNS Name Servers" empty.
        4. Leave "Host Routes" empty.

            ![!Create Subnet dialog box. The Subnet Details tab is selected. The form has been filled out. ><](./images/subnet_004.png){: style="width:70%"}

6. Click "Create".

    1. Redirects to the "Overview" page for the network the subnet was added to.

        ![!my_network overview page. There are three tabs. The Overview tab is selected. ><](./images/subnet_005.png){: style="width:70%"}

    2. Click the "Subnets" tab next to "Overview" to verify the subnet was added to the table for this network.

        ![!my_network overview page. The Subnets tab is selected. The table has one entry labeled my_subnet. ><](./images/subnet_006.png){: style="width:70%"}

## Creating a Router

To follow these directions for creating a router, a [Network](#creating-a-network) and [Subnet](#creating-a-subnet) must already exist.

1. Click "Network" in the left-hand navigation pane to open the fold-out menu.

    ![!cloud.rc Overview page. Routers is selected in the Network Topology fold-out menu in the left-hand navigation pane. ><](./images/networks_000.png){: style="width:70%"}

2. Click "Routers" in the fold-out menu.

    ![!cloud.rc Router page. The Routers table is empty.><](./images/routers_001.png){: style="width:70%"}

3. Click "+ Create Router" to open a dialog box.

4. Fill out the dialog box.

    1. Enter a "Router Name".
    2. Leave "Enable Admin State" checked.
    3. Select "uab-campus" in the "External Network" drop down box.
    4. Leave the "Availability Zone Hints" box empty.

    ![!Create Router dialog. The dialog is filled out. The name is my_router. ><](./images/routers_002.png){: style="width:70%"}

5. Click "Create Router".

    1. Redirects to the "Routers" page.
    2. There should be a new entry in the table with the name given in (4.a)

    ![!cloud.rc Routers page. The Routers table has one entry. The entry is the my_router. ><](./images/routers_003.png){: style="width:70%"}

6. Now we need to connect the router to our subnet. Click the name of the new entry under the "Name" column to open the router "Overview" page.

    ![!my_router overview page. Three tabs are available. The Overview tab is selected. ><](./images/routers_004.png){: style="width:70%"}

7. Click the "Interfaces" tab.

    ![!my_router overview page. The Instances tab is selected. The table is empty. ><](./images/routers_005.png){: style="width:70%"}

8. Click "+ Add Interface" to open a dialog box.

9. Fill out the dialog box.

    1. Select an existing network-subnet pair in the "Subnet" drop down box.
    2. If this is your only router on the selected subnet, leave "IP Address" empty to use the subnet gateway.

    ![!Add Interface dialog. The dialog is filled out. The my_network subnet is selected as subnet. ><](./images/routers_006.png){: style="width:70%"}

10. Click "Submit"

    1. Redirects to the "Interfaces" page for the router.
    2. There should be a new entry in the table.

    ![!my_router overview page. The Instances tab is selected. The table has one entry with a random UUID string as name. ><](./images/routers_007.png){: style="width:70%"}

## Creating a Floating IP

Floating IPs are required if you want an instance to talk to devices on the internet. These IPs are a shared resource, so they must be allocated when needed and released when no longer needed.

1. Click "Network" in the left-hand navigation pane to open the fold-out menu.

    ![!cloud.rc Overview page with Networks selected in the Network Topology fold-out menu in the left-hand navigation pane. ><](./images/networks_000.png){: style="width:70%"}

2. Click "Floating IPs".

    ![!cloud.rc Floating IPs page. The Floating IPs table is empty. ><](./images/floating_ips_001.png){: style="width:70%"}

3. Click "Allocate IP to Project" to open a dialog box.

4. Fill out the dialog box.

    1. Select "uab-campus" in the "Pool" drop down box.
    2. Enter a "Description".
    3. Leave "DNS Domain" empty.
    4. Leave "DNS Name" empty.

    ![!Allocate Floating IP dialog. The dialog form is empty. ><](./images/floating_ips_002.png){: style="width:70%"}

5. Click "Allocate IP".

    1. Redirects to the "Floating IPs" page.
    2. There should be a new entry in the table.

    ![!Floating IPs page. The table has one entry. ><](./images/floating_ips_003.png){: style="width:70%"}
